      <p class="body-1"> In the 90s, a new fashion style swept through Harajuku, the hub for Tokyo's alternative fashion scene, which soon became a cultural movement in the growing fashion community. Lolita fashion is one of the many styles in the Harajuku fashion scene, and there are numerous subgenres within Lolita fashion itself. The style is best described as the epitome of girlhood and femininity. Those who wear Lolita clothing can be seen walking around in the city like vintage dolls come to life, sticking out from the rest of the crowd. Cupcake-like dresses full of pastel pinks, blues, and purples with ruffles, bows, and lace are displayed in numerous shops in Harajuku.</p>
      <p class="body-1">The typical Lolita "coord" or outfit consists of a bell-shaped dress worn with a petticoat underneath. There are two types of Lolita dresses: an "OP" or one piece, which is a dress with short or long sleeves, and a "JSK" or jumper skirt, which is a sleeveless dress with straps and is always layered with a collared blouse underneath. Dresses can come in solid colors or patterns like flowers, cupcakes, fruits, candy, or teddy bears. Accessories such as over-the-knee socks or tights, rounded-toe Mary janes or short heels, hair bows, a headdress, or a beret are necessary to complete an outfit.</p>

      <p class="body-1"> When I first visited Japan in 2015, I had zero interest in fashion. Eight years later, my love for fashion grew, and I revisited Japan. This time, I was determined to "redeem" myself from my previous trip and indulge in all the shopping. While staying in Tokyo, I visited several Lolita brand stores and interacted with authentic Lolita garments for the first time. Two notable places I went to were Angelic Pretty and Baby the Stars Shine Bright, both of which are the most popular and well-respected brands in the Lolita community. 
    </p>
    <p class="body-1">Entering these stores felt like stepping into a new dimension my five-year-old self could only dream of. I remember taking my time and looking through every dress, blouse, hair clip, purse, and pair of socks and shoes, studying all the intricate details in each piece. I was simply in awe of how everything was so beautiful and well-crafted. I would've stuffed my suitcase full if it weren't for the mindblowing price tags, with dresses for over $300 and blouses for over $150. Instead, I bought a pair of pink lace bow clips, sheer white knee-high socks, and pink and white lace wrist cuffs. All of these pieces are some of my most prized fashion items.</p>

    <article class="highlight rating-body" >
     <p class="body-1">I've been fascinated by Harajuku fashion, specifically lolita fashion, for several years. The pastel colors, puffed sleeves, poofy skirts, and piles of ribbon and lace were my perfect eye candy. Like many Lolita fans, I felt so drawn to the style because it was unapologetically nostalgic and it takes me back to a simpler, carefree time in my life. </p>
      <p class="body-1">I appreciate the historical inspirations in lolita fashion, and I think it's really interesting to see elements of Victorian/Rococo fashion in the style. I also love how there's many subgenres within lolita fashion itself, allowing people to find a style they like while staying in the lolita realm. The style's community is very inspiring, and I appreciate how they create a welcoming environment where members can feel their most confident. </p>
